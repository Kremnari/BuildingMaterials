Date: 16 May 18
  Changes:
    - Added several possible burner phase options (view in settings tab)
    - Fixed some progression issues
  Settings:
    - Burner-Stage
    - ------------
      - Normal:
        - No changes, BM class 0 is used in buildings, no automation until you research it
      - Skip Burner:
        - Prevents added BM-0 to buildings, but still sets components as appropriate
      - Basic Automation:
        - Ensures you have basic inserters, belts, and splitters, but not cost reductions
      - SP0:  REQUIRES AAI-Industries
        - Gives a burner lab to start.  Sets basic automation and BM Class 1 research to require SP0
